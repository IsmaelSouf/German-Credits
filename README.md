The file credits.xlsx contains historic observations on 10 variables (attributes) for
1000 past applications for credit. Each applicant was given a rate of “good” (700
cases) or “bad” (300 cases) credit. Based on the applicant’s profile, a bank can make
reasonable decisions about whether or not to award a loan.
